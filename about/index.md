## About Me
A little bit about me, I am a 26yr old INFJ. Currently in the process of learning UI/UX which includes broadening my understanding of art, psychology, programming and design. For the past few weeks, I've been taking the Coursera course on UI and have already learned a lot about what goes into design, which is probably 85% of the course. This is a great thing though IMO, a solid foundation must be built to create the best results. These days (and for the last 12 years) I've been working in the customer service field, but have been starving creatively for quite some time- hence learning new skills and eventually changing my career path. With this much needed change of pace, I am truly looking forward to learning and my future in design.

Some of my current hobbies include reading, painting (rekindling that creativity!), playing video games: first person shooters, side scrollers, growing my beautiful house plants and making tea blends. Tea party, anyone?
